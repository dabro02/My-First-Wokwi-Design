## How it works

Input a custom 4-bit number to the shift register. Use a switch to enable transmission. The LED 8 blinks the given pattern.

## How to test
 
Set a default 4-bit Number on the first 4 Input Switches. The Input is set to the shift register by clock (or by step). After the number is stored in the register, switch 8 (io7) enables the transmission in clock speed.

## External hardware

> 5 Inputs and > 1 LED.
